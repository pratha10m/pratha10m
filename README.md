Welcome to Prathamesh’s GitHub 🌟

Hey 👋
I’m Prathamesh — a Full Stack Developer with a strong focus on JavaScript, backend systems, and practical Web3 experimentation.

I build applications end-to-end, break them, debug them, optimize them, and repeat — because that’s how real engineering skill is built.

👨‍💻 About Me

Background in Computer Science
Full Stack Developer (Frontend + Backend)
Strong focus on JavaScript fundamentals
Exploring Web3, smart contracts, and decentralized systems
I build real projects, not tutorial clones
Coffee is optional. Debugging is not.
I enjoy understanding how systems work under the hood, not just making things “run”.
